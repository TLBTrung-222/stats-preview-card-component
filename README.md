## My process

### Built with

-   CSS custom properties

### What I learned

-   If you want the layout split into multi column with the same width (items have padding), do not use flex. Instead, use grid. [Read here](https://css-tricks.com/equal-columns-with-flexbox-its-more-complicated-than-you-might-think/)

-   How to uppercase the text : 
```css
p {
    text-transform: uppercase;
}
```
